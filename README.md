# practice-music-theory-on-terminal

## Description
Currently, I am learning music theory (guitar) and I wanted to practice identifying notes on the fretboard. So, I created this simple tool that generates random notes and asks you to identify them.

## Features
- This is a simple music theory practice tool that runs on terminal. It generates random notes and asks you to identify them. 

Another feature is coming soon when I learn more music theory concepts. If you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue. ðŸ˜‰
